Classification of claims/news articles into true or fake

### Concern for Fake News:
The phenomenon of Fake news is becoming a matter of contention. With the unstoppable force of misinformation peddled on social media becoming inherent to human, journalists and fact-checking platforms are working solely to analyze and debunk the multitude of false pieces of information.

### Challenges in Political Fact-Checking
In this age of social media, the available fact checkers face two major challenges, one being the fake news thriving more than ever and spreads faster than we could imagine. By the time a fact-checking platform goes about researching the information, the fake information might have already reached a sizeable population of netizens. Secondly, the current state of fact checking comes with individuals' pre-existing beliefs and ideology, and hence they are prone to easy manipulation based on biases.

### Problem Statement
With reference to the challenges stated above, currently journalists and technologists are encompassing to leverage AI techniques of Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Vision and Speech Recognition to perform fact checks in a quicker and more-efficient manner. My team is interested to know the intervention of AI into political fact checking by using machine learning to build a model that can rate a claim as TRUE, PARTLY TRUE or FALSE without any human biases.

### Overview of Approach
A machine learning model using generic “ground truth” dataset provided by DataCup is developed that generalizes the statements/claims by fact-checking articles that classify them. This model is employed on claims made by US politicians, checking the model’s applicability to the US Politics scenario. Discussions and Visualizations are drawn to see what inferences and insights come out of the model. The results show how US politicians leveraged fake-news to gather public support and votes to win 2016 elections and how they continue further to manipulate the peoples’ viewpoint and opinion.

### Limitations
In the mentioned studies, a machine learning model would compare the history of factual claims made by a news outlet against the labels of sites like Snopes or PolitiFact i.e. characterize the reliability of a news source by how many of its claims matched or conflicted with claims that had been fact-checked already. These mechanisms, however, relies on human fact-checking and evaluates only the history of the outlet, not the immediate present.
